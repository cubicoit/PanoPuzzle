# PanoPuzzle
A 360 panoramic puzzle game

The game subdivides the cubefaces of a 360 panorama and rotates some of them - how many can be chosen in the settings via the easy/normal/hard switch.

Still working to get the description, instructions, demo and the code in here.<br>
Currently the repository is open if somebody has issues with PanoPuzzle so they can report them here.

The panopuzzlev2 link will be removed and replaced by the panopuzzle URL in the next week if no major issues are reported.

Main screen when starting the game will look like this

This gives you all the information you need to play the game - just look around by dragging the panoramic image with the finger/mouse or move your mobile device around and click/tap on a tile to rotate it until all the tiles are pointing in the right direction.

Some settings can be changed, puzzles can be selected directly and puzzle categories can be changed by using the clicking/tapping the settings cog icon at the bottom left of the screen
