A 360 panoramic puzzle game - create longer interactions with your 360 images
<br><br>
The game subdivides the cubefaces of a 360 panorama and rotates some of them.<br> 
It is your job to find and rotate all the wrongly rotated ones and restore the 360 panorama to it's original glory.

When starting the game it will look like this

This gives you all the information you need to play the game - just look around by dragging the panoramic image with the finger/mouse or move your mobile device around and click/tap on a tile to rotate it until all the tiles are pointing in the right direction.<br>
Some settings can be changed, puzzles can be selected directly and puzzle categories can be changed by clicking/tapping the settings cog-icon at the bottom left of the screen which will open up a small settings panel.

The game also allows you to zoom out and solve the puzzle looking at the cube from the outside, a tile counter can be en/disabled to make it easier/harder and you can share a specific puzzle via the share button on the bottom right.
